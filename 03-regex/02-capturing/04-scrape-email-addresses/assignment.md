# Assignment

Write a function `scrape_email_addresses(string)` that extracts all email addresses
occurring in `string`.
Here's a brief comparison:

match(): Use this method when you want to check if the pattern matches at the beginning of the string.
fullmatch(): Use this method when you want to check if the entire string exactly matches the pattern.
findall(): Use this method when you want to find all occurrences of the pattern within the string.
